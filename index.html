		Hello, my name is Michael and I'm a C programmer with a fascination for all things high performance, low-latency, operating systems, kernels, databases, and more.
        Here you will find a random assortment of stuff I want to share with no rhyme or reason. Some of it related to programming, some not.

		<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>
                I love the Super Nintendo. I love computers from the 1980s and 1990s. And I've always wanted to try
                making an emulator. So why not tackle a CPU that existed in both the SNES and Apple computer? Even
                crazier, why not make a full OS for this chip too?

            <li>
                Imagine reducing cache misses and table walks without changing a line of code? Linux is somewhat stuck
                in the past and still using 4K page sizes but supports up to 1GB. You got all that ram, your CPU cache
                is growing with each generation, so let's make use of that and see some scaled performance benefits.

			<li>Automotive aesthetic for cars I've modified myself. All work completed by me with numerous one-off parts to create uniqueness. I'm very inspired by mid-late 90s and early 00s computing design with specific color contrast plus direct and accessible style. The simplicity lends itself to my extreme car productions. These are more of an art form than a driver's car.

		Hyannis Port Research - Principal Software Engineer        [Oct. 2023 - present]<br>
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
			<li>
				Technical lead, mentor, project manager, and individual contributor to ultra low latency multi-threaded and multi-process software portfolio of HPR.
			</li>
			<li>
				Designed and implemented an off-core lock-free multi-producer single-consumer logging module for high throughput logging without impacting main datapath performance.
			</li>
			<li>
				Created production runtime performance tracer for applications by inserting special probes defined in a registry that generates timings of function entry/exit and off-core logs the data.
				This is used to find bottlenecks in production and reduce high latency events for pre-trade risk analysis.
			</li>
			<li>
				Managed global infrastructure fleet, guiding engineers to generate better processes and automation for secure co-located exchange deployments.
			</li>
			<li>
				Implemented an application start-up memory allocator to remove all runtime dynamic allocations using memory maps and an easy to use developer API.
			</li>
			<li>
				Developed a runtime ELF binary re-map to hugepages increasing performance by 20% and significantly reducing both data and instruction cache misses.
			</li>
			<li>
				Built custom linker scripts for specific organization and alignment of data and text in ELF binaries for tighter datapaths increasing performance at scale.
			</li>
			<li>
				Created advanced data structures in C and x86 SIMD such as Adaptive Radix Tree that improved throughput consistency and doubled overall performance.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mentored and pair programmed with junior engineer to implement a reverse stack walker for fault handling in emergency scenarios without core files (such as smashed stack).
				This was done in C and x86 assembly and proved useful during a production outage where coredump was unavailable, but using this tool we got register dump, ELF offsets of the stack
				and a stack memory dump of the POSIX thread which failed and ultimately could determine root cause.
			</li>
			<li>
				Improved application architecture by moving from a single process to splitting out non-critical services off the main data path and into separate process space so in event of
				failure clients can still access orders in the stock exchange without risk.
			</li>
			<li>
				Analyzed customer experience by designing and creating a stock market simulator in C++ and C. I led the design and mentored 2 junior engineers to aide in implementation which first
				phase supporting NASDAQ OUCH was complete in a couple weeks allowing us to test prod-like configurations and ultimately finding many bugs with this environment of our products.
			</li>
			<li>
				Worked on custom order sender for internal testing to understand customer usage with QuickFIX library
			</li>
			<li>
				Set up the company's first Grafana dashboards tracking historical median latency, throughput, test failures, flamegraphs, and more for weekly dashboard review meetings
			</li>
			<li>
				Lead designer of asynchronous price collar calculations for broker trade risk management by analyzing market data feeds and applying to the fleet
			</li>
			<li>
				Led internal teaching sessions of linux IPC, optimization techniques, linux tools (gdb, valgrind, etc), and data structures for expanding ideas to create better performing features
			</li>
			<li>
				Deep dive into Xilinx Solarflare FPGA network cards for network stack offload out of kernel
			</li>
			<li>
				Created yearly product roadmap to drive recruitment, product improvement, and understand industry needs. This kept employees motivated by getting opportunity to work on fun, high-performance
				features.
			</li>
			<li>
				Standardized interview process by designating roles for the interviewers and assigning behavioral and technical categories. This revolutionized hiring at HPR and went from difficulty recruiting
				to better understanding what was desired in candidates and resulting in hiring more.
			</li>
            <li>
                Used Xilinx Solarflare with OpenOnload for userspace RDMA networking. Explored XDP and ebpf for further fine tuning of network stack, packetization, and kernel bypass.
            </li>
